## Interview Questions

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

    Accessibility on the web is the method of creating a website that accomodates people of
    all abilities and differences. For instance, creating a site with semantic
    HTML tags, so that a blind user may be able to easily use a screen reader to relay
    the information on your page.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

    -Using semantic HTML tags, so that your site is more friendly for screen readers
    -Using symbols along with color, so that you can relay important information (like
     error messages) to individuals that may be color blind or need to use your site in
     greyscale
    -Using scalable forms of measurement when designing your pages, so that users who need
     to adjust their screen's size or resolution for easier viewing can still enjoy your
     site

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

    A variable is sort of like a storage container for your code. It is a way to store 
    data so that you can access it easily later on. Some variables can be changed, and others
    cannot.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

    Functions are like small computer programs. They are a way to make your code
    perform certain tasks.
